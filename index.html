    <h3>Ugly UI Screenshot</h3>
    <p>This is a screenshot of GitHub's repository creation page that has some UI problems:</p>

    <h3>What's Wrong With This UI?</h3>
    
    <h4>Problem 1: Hard to See Important Stuff</h4>
    <p>The background is too dark and everything looks the same. You can't tell what's important and what's not. The required fields have tiny asterisks that are easy to miss.</p>
    <p><b>How to fix it:</b> Use a lighter background and make important fields stand out more. Make required field markers bigger and more obvious.</p>
    
    <h4>Problem 2: Confusing Buttons</h4>
    <p>The toggle switches and dropdowns don't look clickable. You can't tell if they're on or off easily.</p>
    <p><b>How to fix it:</b> Use regular checkboxes instead of toggle switches. Make buttons look more like buttons with clear labels.</p>
    
    <h4>Problem 3: Text is Too Small</h4>
    <p>A lot of the helper text and descriptions are really small and hard to read, especially the green success message.</p>
    <p><b>How to fix it:</b> Make the font size bigger (at least 16px for regular text). Use better contrast colors.</p>
    
    <h4>Problem 4: Bad Spacing</h4>
    <p>Everything is cramped together and there's not enough space between sections. It's hard to see where one section ends and another begins.</p>
    <p><b>How to fix it:</b> Add more padding and margin. Put boxes around related items to group them together.</p>
    
    <h4>Problem 5: Messy Layout</h4>
    <p>The form fields aren't aligned well. The owner dropdown and repository name are at different heights which looks weird.</p>
    <p><b>How to fix it:</b> Line everything up vertically. Stack form fields on top of each other instead of side by side.</p>
